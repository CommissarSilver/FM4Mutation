    "bug_description": "Bug ID: 3\nProject Name: JacksonCore\nBug Type: Statement Fault (SF)\n\nTest Error Message: \njunit.framework.AssertionFailedError: expected:<0> but was:<3>. This test error message shows that the unit test expected 0, but received 3. \n\nOriginal Code:\nThe original code is a constructor for a UTF8StreamJsonParser class. It accepts several parameters including IO context, features, an input stream, a codec, a symbol, an input buffer, start, end and a boolean flag to indicate whether the buffer is recyclable. The constructor initializes these fields properly but it misses two important initializations, `_currInputRowStart` and `_currInputProcessed`, which might be causing the issue.\n\nBug Details:\nThe bug in the code lies in the omission of initializing `_currInputRowStart` and `_currInputProcessed`. As a result, these variables would have default values according to their data types. If these variables are used later in the program, it might cause undesired behavior in the program such as wrong calculation or null pointer exceptions. \n\nFixed Code:\nIn the fixed code version, `_currInputRowStart` is initialized with the value of `start` and `_currInputProcessed` is initialized with `-start`. These additional lines of code correct the aforementioned omissions, accounting for the offset if one exists.\n\nStep-By-Step Bug Description:\n1. A new instance of `UTF8StreamJsonParser class` is created and the constructor is called with all required parameters.\n2. All the input parameters are assigned to the corresponding class variables correctly.\n3. However, the variables `_currInputRowStart` and `_currInputProcessed` are not assigned any values, left then with their default values.\n4. Later in the program, using these variables could lead to unexpected behavior since they do not have the appropriate initialized values.\n5. The unit test fails as it expected to get the output <0>, but due to this bug, the unit test returns <3>.\n6. In the corrected version of the code, adding `_currInputRowStart = start;` and `_currInputProcessed = -start;` assigns the correct values to both variables.\n7. The fixed code should pass the unit test successfully after this modification."
