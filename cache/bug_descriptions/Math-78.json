    "bug_description": "Bug ID: 78\n\n1. Project: The bug is found in the Math project.\n\n2. Bug Type: The bug type is SF (Software Fault).\n\n3. Error Message: The error message thrown is \"org.apache.commons.math.MathRuntimeException$4: function values at endpoints do not have different signs. Endpoints: [89.999, 153.1], Values: [-0.066, -1,142.11]\". This error indicates that the endpoints do not have different value signs, which is a necessary condition for the function solve in BrentSolver.\n\n4. Description: \n   - In the buggy code, a corner case was not handled correctly. This corner case scenario refers to the situation when there is an event near one endpoint (ta), and another event between the two endpoints (ta and tb). When ga and gb are computed, an incorrect convergence is reached on the \"wrong side\" of the interval, implying that the real signs of ga and gb are the same. However, this is not caught and handled in the problematic code, causing the aforementioned error.\n   - The incorrect handling of this scenario in the code causes the `solve` function in BrentSolver to throw an error because the function expectations (i.e. ga * gb < 0) are not met.\n\n5. Solution: The fix in the fixed code lies in adding a condition to check if ge and gb have the same sign (indicating the \"corner case\" scenario). If they do, ta is adjusted slightly in forward direction to ensure that ga and gb have opposite signs, thus ensuring the conditions necessary for the `solve` function in BrentSolver are met. An error is also thrown if, after adjustment, ga and gb still have the same sign.\n\n6. Steps to generate artificial bugs:\n   - Remove the 'corner case' scenario check and handling from the fixed code.\n   - Instead, let the code proceed without checking if ga and gb have the same sign before calling the `solve` function in BrentSolver.\n   - This will likely cause a MathRuntimeException when the `solve` function in BrentSolver is called, simulating the original issue."
